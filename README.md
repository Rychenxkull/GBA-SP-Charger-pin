# GBA-SP-Charger-pin
Nintendo GAMEBOY ADVANCE SP charger pin 3D file and circuit board

- This is a project for people who have lost/damaged their charger or cant buy online due to region unavailability or high price
-
- 3D printed charger pin has two parts: 1) the pin, 2) the cap
- I have kept space for the actual connectors which will be a PCB that I will design soon
- The PCB will auto lock in place as I have designed it that way
- The cap will also tighly close as it is designed that way too so that there is no need for screws
- I will make a demonstration tutorial video once everything is ready
- NOTE: This is just in the testing phase and may not be perfect
-
- PCB thickness must be 1.6mm when printing PCB
- Gerber file for PCB printing added
